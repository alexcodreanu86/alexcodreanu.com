      <h1>One thing that I really enjoyed as a kid was getting myself dirty... In the summer of 2013 some of my friends, with my brother, my wife and I had the chance to run the "Color Me RAD" 5k. It was really nice to share this experience with so many people that wanted the same thing as me : to get home as dirty as posible.</h1>

      <h2>Me and my favorite person in the world</h2>
      <p>Yes, she is the chosen one :-). Every day when I wake up, she either puts a smile on my face, or... a good beating. She is more dangerous than she looks. I get to witness that every day... in theory, for the rest of my life. <br>At least that is what I have been told :-)</p>

      <p>First is Freddy our <a href="#">Ball Python</a> and second is Vasilika, our <a href="#">Robo hamster</a>. Freddy would love to have Vasilika as his roommate, but I have a feeling that it wouldn't last for too long... Vasilika is a grumpy litle guy... </p>
